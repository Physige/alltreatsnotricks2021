# All Treats No Tricks 2021
This is a fun little activity for kids at the CS Club table during All Treats No Tricks 2021. You hit space to spin the wheel, whatever candy you land on is what you get. Pretty simple. You can also toggle what candies can be landed on with numbers 1-4 on your keyboard. This will make it so it's impossible to land on that specific candy. NOTE: If all candies are disabled, the M&Ms, by default, will renable.
